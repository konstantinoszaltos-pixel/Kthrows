    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>My name is [Your Name], and I started Kthrows to share my passion for throwing and to help athletes achieve their goals. From my journey as a Division 1 thrower to coaching others, I’ve learned the importance of hard work, resilience, and proper guidance. Minnesota became my second home and the place where I grew as both an athlete and a coach. Now, I’m here to help the next generation of throwers succeed.</p>
